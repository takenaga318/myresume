    <h1>Favorite Games</h1>
    <h2 style="color:#FD0371;">Celeste</h2>
    <p>
        In general, the mechanics of the game run so smoothly that<br />
        it remains an inspiration to me on how in-control of a character<br />
        you're supposed to feel.

    <h2 style="color:#672FFA;">World of Final Fantasy</h2>
    <p>
        The amount of voice acting and animation dedicated to this<br />
        game is so impressive, and the battle mechanics are refreshingly<br />
        original. As a fan of Final Fantasy, it also includes characters<br />
        from other games and makes me think of Pokemon when I play it.

    <h2 style="color:#6D6D6D;">Ark: Survival Evolved</h2>
    <p>
        Terrifying to play but simply, ridiculously cool.<br />

    <h2 style="color:#10B11C;">Stardew Valley</h2>
    <p>It's Stardew Valley, need I say more?</p>

    <h2 style="color:#AB0101;">Divinity: Original Sin</h2>
    <p>
        This game gave me a taste for thievery. Besides that, I just love<br />
        the characters, the intricacy, the point-based combat that plays<br />
        like a board game, and the overall sense that my choices matter.

    <h2 style="color:#2200B9;">Ori and the Blind Forest</h2>
    <p>
        It's simply beautiful and touching. While at the same time being,<br />
        throw your chair level difficult.
